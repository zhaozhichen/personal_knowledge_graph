# René Descartes: A Brief Summary

## Early Life and Education

René Descartes (1596–1650) was a French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist, often referred to as the "father of modern philosophy." Born in La Haye en Touraine, France, he lost his mother at a young age. Descartes attended the Jesuit Collège Royal Henry-Le-Grand at La Flèche, where he was introduced to mathematics and physics. He later earned a law degree from the University of Poitiers in 1616 but chose not to practice law.

## Major Contributions

### Philosophy

Descartes is renowned for his statement **"Cogito, ergo sum"** ("I think, therefore I am"), which became a foundational element of Western rationalism. His method of **systematic doubt** and emphasis on reason marked a departure from scholastic traditions. In *Meditations on First Philosophy* (1641), he explores the nature of **knowledge, existence, and the mind-body relationship**.

### Mathematics

In *La Géométrie* (1637), Descartes introduced the **Cartesian coordinate system**, merging algebra and Euclidean geometry. This work laid the groundwork for **analytic geometry** and influenced the development of calculus.

### Science

Descartes made significant contributions to **optics** and proposed a **mechanistic model of the universe**. His work *Le Monde* (*The World*) presents a comprehensive view of his physical theories, although he withheld its publication after learning of Galileo's condemnation.

## Later Life and Legacy

In 1649, Descartes moved to **Sweden** at the invitation of **Queen Christina** to tutor her in philosophy. Accustomed to working late, the early morning sessions in the cold Swedish climate adversely affected his health. He died of **pneumonia in Stockholm in 1650**. Descartes's ideas have had a lasting impact on **philosophy, mathematics, and science**, and continue to be studied and debated today.
