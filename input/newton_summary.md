# Sir Isaac Newton: A Brief Summary  

## Early Life and Education  
Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, and theologian, regarded as one of the most influential scientists in history.  

Born in Woolsthorpe, England, he faced an early life of hardship after his father died before his birth. He was raised by his grandmother while his mother remarried. Newton attended The King's School in Grantham before enrolling at **Trinity College, Cambridge**, in 1661. He initially worked as a **subsizar** (a student who performed menial tasks for financial support) and later earned a scholarship in 1664.  

## Major Contributions  

### Mathematics  
Newton made significant contributions to mathematics, including:  

- **Calculus**: Independently developed infinitesimal calculus alongside **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz**, revolutionizing mathematical analysis.  
- **Binomial Theorem**: Generalized the binomial theorem to apply to non-integer exponents.  
- **Newton's Method**: Introduced an iterative method for approximating the roots of real-valued functions.  

### Physics and Astronomy  
Newton's most famous scientific works include:  

- **Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687)**: This book formulated the **three laws of motion** and the **law of universal gravitation**, laying the foundation for classical mechanics.  
- **Universal Gravitation**: Proposed that gravity acts between all matter, explaining both the motion of planets and objects on Earth.  
- **Reflecting Telescope**: Built the first practical **reflecting telescope**, improving upon refracting telescopes by reducing chromatic aberration.  

### Optics  
Newton also made groundbreaking discoveries in optics:  

- **Light Spectrum**: Showed that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors by passing it through a **prism**.  
- **Particle Theory of Light**: Proposed that light consists of particles, influencing later developments in quantum mechanics.  

## Later Life and Legacy  
Later in life, Newton served as **Warden** and then **Master of the Royal Mint**, reforming England's currency system. He became **President of the Royal Society** in 1703 and was **knighted by Queen Anne** in 1705.  

Newton's discoveries formed the bedrock of **classical physics**, and his rigorous scientific methods continue to influence scientific research to this day.
