# Albert Einstein: A Brief Summary  

## Early Life and Education  
Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who revolutionized physics with his theories of relativity. Born in Ulm, Germany, he showed an early talent for mathematics and physics. He studied at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zurich, earning his teaching diploma in 1900.  

## Annus Mirabilis and Major Contributions  
In 1905, often called Einstein's "miracle year" (*annus mirabilis*), he published four groundbreaking papers. These works introduced:  

- The **theory of special relativity**, reshaping our understanding of space and time.  
- The **photoelectric effect**, which laid the foundation for quantum mechanics and later earned him the **1921 Nobel Prize in Physics**.  
- **Brownian motion**, providing strong evidence for the existence of atoms.  
- **Mass-energy equivalence**, expressed in the famous equation **E = mc²**.  

## General Relativity and Later Work  
In 1915, Einstein developed the **general theory of relativity**, proposing that gravity results from the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. This theory was confirmed in 1919 when observations of a solar eclipse showed that light bends around massive objects, bringing Einstein global fame.  

## Personal Life  
Einstein married **Mileva Marić** in 1903, and they had three children. After their divorce in 1919, he married his cousin **Elsa Löwenthal**.  

## Political and Social Engagement  
A **pacifist and humanitarian**, Einstein opposed nationalism and militarism. He fled Germany in 1933 when Adolf Hitler rose to power, moving to the United States and becoming a professor at the **Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton**. He became a U.S. citizen in 1940 and later advocated for civil rights, nuclear disarmament, and global peace.  

## Legacy  
Einstein's contributions revolutionized physics, influencing fields such as **cosmology, quantum mechanics, and statistical physics**. His name remains synonymous with genius, and his discoveries continue to shape scientific advancements today.
